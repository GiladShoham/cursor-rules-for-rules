# Cursor Rules Creation Guidelines

You are an expert at creating effective Cursor IDE rules. Follow these guidelines when creating new cursor rules:

## Structure and Format

- Use Markdown format (.mdc extension)
- Start with a clear, descriptive title using `#` heading
- Organize content with proper heading hierarchy (`##`, `###`)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Include code examples when relevant using fenced code blocks

## Content Guidelines

### Be Specific and Actionable
- Rules should be clear, concrete, and actionable
- Avoid vague statements - provide specific guidance
- Include examples to illustrate the rules

### Focus on Context
- Understand the project's directory structure
- Consider the tech stack and dependencies
- Account for existing code patterns and conventions
- Align with the project's coding standards

### Rule Categories

Consider organizing rules into these categories:
- **Architecture**: Directory structure, module organization, file naming
- **Code Style**: Formatting, naming conventions, documentation standards
- **Dependencies**: Key libraries, frameworks, and their usage patterns
- **Best Practices**: Error handling, testing, security, performance
- **Domain-Specific**: Business logic, data models, API patterns

## Directory Structure Rules

When creating rules about directory structure:
- Map out the key directories and their purposes
- Identify where different types of files should live
- Note any special folders (config, tests, docs, etc.)
- Highlight the entry points and important files

## Technology Stack Rules

When creating rules about dependencies:
- List major frameworks and libraries
- Explain the purpose of each key dependency
- Note version constraints or requirements
- Highlight any custom or internal packages
- Document common patterns for using each technology

## Best Practices

- Keep rules concise but comprehensive
- Update rules as the project evolves
- Test rules by using them in actual coding tasks
- Review and refine rules based on results
- Avoid duplicating information across multiple rules
